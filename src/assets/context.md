# Database Context

## test_db

This is a sample e-commerce database designed for testing database access patterns and permissions. The database demonstrates a typical web application structure with user management and product catalog functionality.

### users table

Stores user account information for the system. This table represents registered users who might interact with the e-commerce platform. Each user has a unique username and email address, with timestamps tracking when accounts were created. The sample data includes regular users and an admin account.

### products table

Contains the product catalog for the e-commerce system. Each product has essential retail information including pricing, categorization, and inventory status. Products are organized into categories (like "Category A" and "Category B") and include an availability flag to indicate whether items are currently in stock. This table would typically be used for product listings, search functionality, and order processing.
